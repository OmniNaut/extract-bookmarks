# problem
Modern broswers do not often export bookmarks into multiple shortcut/link files. They instead create a single html export file. While faster, this approach does not allow a user to easily index bookmark files when using launcher tools like the Windows Search, Cortana, Launchy, Wox, Everything and PowerToys Run 

# summary
Exports and extracts bookmarks from Chrome, Firefox and Edge into a folder that can be easily archived by launchers like Windows Search, Cortana, Launchy, Wox, Everything and PowerToys Run.

# future
1. Add dialog so user can input path to JSON bookmark files in Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Or, build search script to find the paths of these files and insert them into an array.
2. Combine export and extract scripts to minimize redundant code and increase speed.
3. Test application with all launcher tools. I have only tested this program with PowerToys Run as it is supported by Microsoft, secure and fairly stable.
